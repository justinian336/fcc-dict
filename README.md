`fcc-dict.js` was created to assist the internationalization effort at [freecodecamp.com](FreeCodeCamp). It solves two common problems in collective translation efforts:
1. There rarely is a unique translation for each English term you find on the challenges. Regional differences make it difficult to achieve an agreement (for example, Spaniards translate `array` as `vector`, while many Latin Americans translate it as `arreglo`. None of them is wrong, but we can only choose one. `fcc-dict.js` allows all translators to propose their suggestions for a given term, and runs a permanent poll that can be responded by other translators and users. This brings democracy to your translation.
2. Organizing the data employed for the translation effort is a **chore**, and all teams have to go through it. `fcc-dict` puts all this information into an API and provides an easy-to-use interface, all in one place. This API is a nice by-product of the translation effort and can be useful for other projects (for example, for the translators working on the [https://developer.mozilla.org](MDN documentation)).

To run it, clone the repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, `mongod --smallfiles` to start the database and `node server.js` to run the server.
